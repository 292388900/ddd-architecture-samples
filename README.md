# DDD Architecture Samples

> *At first, you must remember, a simple blog system often does not need to use a DDD workshop (like Event Storming) to design and apply a complex architecture.*

> *However, when you are skilled, you will find DDD thinking is very usefully for your daily thought. Also, your modeling speed will be more and more fast. So you can quickly complete all the design process in your brain.*

These examples aim to demonstrate a DDD architecture with different tech stacks, which can work in the real project and let you understand and reference quickly.

When designing these samples, I refer to the following architecture patterns:

- [Hexagonal Architecture](http://alistair.cockburn.us/Hexagonal+architecture)
- [Onion Architecture](https://jeffreypalermo.com/2008/07/the-onion-architecture-part-1/)
- [Clean Architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html)
- [Microservice](https://www.martinfowler.com/microservices/)

And I designed them with these principles (you can call it ***CUPET***):
- Easy to **C**ode
- Easy to **U**nderstand
- Easy to **P**rotect
- Easy to **E**xtend
- Easy to **T**est
