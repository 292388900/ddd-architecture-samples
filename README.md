# Hexagonal Architecture Samples

> *At first, you must remember, a simple blog system often does not need to use a DDD workshop (like Event Storming) to design and apply a complex architecture.*

> *However, when you are skilled, you will find DDD thinking is very usefully for your daily thought. Also, your modeling speed will be more and more fast. So you can quickly complete all the design process in your brain.*

> *Hexagonal Architecture is one of the architectures in conformity with DDD thinking. These examples aim to demonstrate the application of hexagonal structure, to allow you to understand and reference quickly.*
